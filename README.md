* Expense Description (multi line text field)
* Expense Cost (currency)

All the fields are required.

Create a SharePoint Framework web part that allows users of the Finance Department to submit their expense claims online.

* HR – HR Expense Claims
* Operations – Operations Expense Claims.

### Task Description
Update your SharePoint Framework webpart to allow it to be deployed by other departments while having any submissions be stored in the correct backend list.

## Task 3
Multiple departments are now using the Expenses Claims form and performance is becoming a problem.

### Task Description
Update your SharePoint Framework Web Part to use an Office 365 CDN to deliver the assets required for the Web Part.
